# ðŸ›’ E-Commerce Store Database (MySQL)

This project is part of the **SQL Developer Internship Task 1**. It demonstrates the design, development, and structure of a **relational database** for an e-commerce platform using **MySQL** and **MySQL Workbench**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a normalized and relational database schema that supports common e-commerce functionality, such as:

- User registration
- Product catalog
- Shopping cart
- Order placement
- Payments and shipping

This setup is scalable and designed to maintain **data integrity**, **avoid redundancy**, and support **future features** like reviews, product filters, and admin management.
